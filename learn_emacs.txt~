The issues raises a highly argumentative topic that we usually lean much more from people we have the same opinions with than the ones we disagree with base on the premise that disagreement leaves one susceptible to stress and impasses learning. It is however an untenable fact that things we hate or against has a level of stress impact on us, but as much as we are living in this world we will not always have our way and is much politic to take lessons from the things we disagree with. I am therefore against the stance taken by the author and rather believe that one can learn equally from people he disagrees with based on his perception and how he evaluates situations.
Firstly, ones perception about issues is very significant in our quest to gain knowledge and insight about our environment and it is highly imperative that we realise the mere fact we are right does not necessarily mean the other persons opinion or view is false. There is a popular image where six is written on the floor and two men are placed at opposite sides to check the value. One man said is six whilst the other on the opposite sides also saw it as nine. In a situation like both of them could decide to disagree and learn nothing from these situation or they could rather exchange positions and learn some thing new about turning around the digit six as the proverb goes, “ wisdom is not fo	fund in the brain of one person”.

In addition, there are certain instances where our disagreement about issues rather turn on our intellectual curiosity about these issues in other to find new theories about the solution to these issues. This has been the basis of many science theories. Years back scientist promulgated that the earth was flat, years later Gallileo Gallilee a scientist and a philosopher came out to contradict the earlier notion that the earth was flat, claiming that the earth was rather spherixl. Although he was killed at that time because people felt that he was blaspheming, it was later realised his claim was very true. The people who killed him decided not to evaluate Gallileos stance and decided to be parochial in thinking. But years later, other scientist who decided to examine his stance realised that it was the right theory.
Although is very enervating to have your claim or research or opinion been contended, and it can be very stressful at times. Nevertheless, human beings are able to exude the best out of them when challenged. Hence is very much prudent that we examine the stance of people and situations we disagree since is only then that we can fully learn to modify the things we already knw or unlearn them. We can equally learn from what challenges us as we learn from things that indulges us.
